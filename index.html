      <p>Your school wants to improve the upkeep of campus facilities by creating a new system for reporting any facilities that may need maintenance or repair. Design an experience that allows students to report building or equipment issues on campus. Consider the process of those filing the report and of those receiving and taking action on the issues.</p>

        <h2>My Process</h2>
        <p>
          For this problem, I've decided to look into the maintenance request system of Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT)â€”to evaluate it then build from it. The first step I took in approaching the design prompt was to identify the problem. "What did we have and what are the issues with it?" Answering these questions would help me build a better solution. To do this, I've evaluated the system in two ways: through contextual inquiry and heuristic evaluation. Ideally, the contextual inquiry would be conducted with more users and with input from those receiving the orders, however, I was unable to do this due to time constraint. After conducting one contextual inquiry and a heuristic evaluation of the system, I move on to step two. </p>
        <p>
          Step two is where I started to create the solution. I gradually built up my prototype by creating a breadboard, followed by a wireframe, then the high-fidelity prototype. I designed the interfaces as much as I was able to, however, I was unable to create the prototype with transitions and effects. </p>
        <p>
          Overall, I'm very proud of what I've accomplished and hope that it's sufficient as part of my application. I enjoyed the challenge and look forward to facing more of them soon. </p>

      <h2 id="problem">Identifying the Problem</h2>

      <article id="contextual-inquiry">
        <h3>Contextual Inquiry</h3>
        <p>
        The users are given a task to complete using IIT's maintenance request system. The task for this contextual inquiry (CI) is to submit a request regarding cockroaches being found in the first floor restroom of Kaplan Institute. Users are requested to talk as they think and are encouraged to interact freely with the interface. For this CI we will not be officially submitting anything to the maintenance system, but will complete all steps before the submission.</p>
        <p>For brevity, I did not include the full transcript of the CI, instead I've included an outline of the steps they took with their observations. Each user will have a profile summary followed by their insights from their performance.</p>

            <h5>Insights</h5>
            <figure><img src="assets/images/ss1.png" alt="Home page for system maintenance requests">
              <figcaption>This is the home page of the maintenance request system. Mina shares that the website is unappealing and underwhelming. She points out the wasted space on the right and the almost empty navigation bar on the left.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure><img src="assets/images/ss2.png" alt="Categories of maintenance issues">
              <figcaption>For the task at hand, Mina felt unsure whether to choose 'Restroom Issues' or 'Pest Control'. She chooses to go for 'Pest Control'.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure><img src="assets/images/ss3.png" alt="Pop-up form">
              <figcaption>Upon clicking 'Pest Control' the issue form is displayed as a pop-up box with four different fields. Mina remarks, "I don't like this pop-up box because I have an automatic reaction to immediately close them, but obviously I shouldn't if I want to submit this form."</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure><img src="assets/images/ss4.png" alt="Suggested result for building name">
              <figcaption>The system suggests a result as Mina types the building name of Kaplan Institute. She's quite impressed with this since Kaplan Institute is a new building and she wasn't sure if the school would have updated the building list.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure><img src="assets/images/ss5.png" alt="Error with abbreviated names">
              <figcaption>Mina tries to input other building names to see how the system would behave. At one point she enters "mtcc" which is the name that students use to refer to the McCormick Tribute Campus Center. She frustratingly comments, "It says that MTCC isn't a building, but if it's not then what is it?" She types in "McCormick" which gives the correct result. Out of curiosity, she clicks on the blue icon on the right of the 'Building' field to choose from the list of buildings and select MTCC.</figcaption>

            <figure><img src="assets/images/ss6.png" alt="A new pop-up box for building selection">
              <figcaption>A new pop-up box containing the building list opens on top of the current one. Mina says, "I'm bothered because this feels like inception. It's like they're trying to see how gray they can make everything." She then exits the building list.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure><img src="assets/images/ss7.png" alt="A new pop-up box for room selection">
              <figcaption>Mina clicked on the blue icon of the "Room #" field which displayed another pop-up box. Mina comments, "I'm annoyed. They have a scrolling list that goes vertically but it also only shows 10 items, then you have to click on this left arrow." Mina was unable to find the first floor restroom on the room list and becomes even more frustrated. She says, "I guess I realized that I made a huge mistake because there's no room option for bathrooms so I guess I should have picked 'Restroom Issues' instead! How was I supposed to know that? Now I have to do it all over again."</figcaption>

            <figure><img src="assets/images/ss9.png" alt="Type in 'Other' as request">
              <figcaption>Mina exits the form she was filling and selects 'Restroom Issues' to start the whole process again. She fills the other fields and gets to the request specification. There was no option for 'Pest Control' in the list so she had to select 'Other' and type in her request. Needless to say, she didn't like it.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure><img src="assets/images/ss8.png" alt="Drag and drop file">
              <figcaption>Finally she reaches the 'Files' upload box. She remarks that she likes the ability to drag her items to the box to upload. She uploads an image and completes the form.</figcaption>

        <h3>Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
        <p>
        In this section, I will be pointing out components from the existing system which cause friction to the user experience. I will be applying Principles of Heuristic Evaluation by Jakob Nielsen to assess these components and provide a possible solution to the issue.</p>
        <article class="he-issue method-article">
          <h4>Home Page</h4>
          <figure>
            <img src="assets/images/he1.png" alt="Home page">
          </figure>
          <p>
          This is the current system's home page. There are 5 main components to it: the request form, the student's submitted requests, the welcome guide, the navigation, and the system buttons located at the top right corner. The problem with this home page is that it fails to have an aesthetic and minimalist design. There are way too many things happening at once and there isn't a focal point where the users can immediately draw their attention to. There is no clear hierarchy in the interface and without it, users have a hard time navigating their way towards their goal.</p>
          <p>To resolve this, instead of having five main components, we could have two: the request form, and the navigation bar. In the navigation bar, users will be able to access their submitted requests, system settings, and the welcome guide as well.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="he-issue method-article">
          <h4>Form</h4>
          <figure>
            <img src="assets/images/ss3.png" alt="Home page">
          </figure>
          <p>
          The request form in the current system is presented as a pop-up box. From the contextual inquiry, we can see that this gives the users a feeling of restlessness since pop-up boxes are more commonly used for brief interactions such as confirmations or notifications. Having the form displayed as a pop-up violates the principle of consistency. In order to remain consistent, we must be predictable.</p>
          <p>We can improve this by directing the user to a different page altogether, fully designed and intended as a request form. Not only would this remove the issue of having a pop-up box, but it would also make space for the components to be better designed.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="he-issue method-article">
          <h4>Form Layout</h4>
          <figure>
            <img src="assets/images/he2.png" alt="Request form">
          </figure>
          <p>
          Looking closer, we can see the necessary fields in the form. At the top we can find the requestor information. This might be important to know if the user is on the receiving end of the order, however, this is simply unimportant and unnecessary to the student who is filling the form. Following that, we have the fields for the building and room number. Upon selecting a building, the form will display the address. Similar to the requestor information, this is information that the user does not need. For a better interface design, we need to keep the user in mind and show only the relevant information to keep a clean interface. It would be optimal to remove both of these information from the form.</p>
          <p>The search functions for the 'Building' field is great and functional, however a problem that arose from the contextual inquiry was its inability to find the building name with its abbreviation. To apply the principle of User Control and Freedom, the interface should also match user input with the abbreviated or colloquial names of the building.</p>
          <p>
          Inside the 'Room #' field, there is instruction saying, "Please enter room number after selecting a building". However, this field still accepts input even if the 'Building' field is empty. This could lead an error in submission. To exercise error prevention, the 'Room #' field should be disabled from editing until there is a valid value in the 'Building' field.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="he-issue method-article">
          <h4>Building and Room Selection</h4>
          <figure id="img-two-col">
            <img src="assets/images/ss6.png" alt="Building list">
            <img src="assets/images/ss7.png" alt="Room list">
          </figure>
          <p>
          If the user chooses to click on the blue icon found on the right of the 'Building' and 'Room #' fields, they will find a new pop-up card appear on top of their current pop-up form. As mentioned before, we don't want the form to be presented in this manner. We can also observe that there are multiple fields in both of these lists where users can type in the room they're looking for. Similar to my evaluation on the previous item, this interface confines user freedom and demands that the right query be entered in the right field. A better way to go about this would be to have one field that accepts any of these fields, whether it's the name, number, or code. This allows the user more freedom and less chance of a resulting error.</p>
          <p>
          There is also a list that accompanies the search fields. However, this spans multiple pages and can take a while for the user to find their target if they choose to ignore the search fields above. To make the list more efficient and easy to navigate, perhaps a collapsible list would be easier. Building or rooms under the same category would be grouped together. This way, the list would be shorter, easier to understand, and faster to navigate.</p>

      <h2 id="solution">Creating the Solution</h2>
      <p>
      To create the solution, I have used three methods which helped me build the my final idea. I've decided to design four interfaces. The first would be the home page. Second is the maintenance request form which is filled by the student, and to be submitted to the maintenance department. The third is an interface which would allow students to view and manage their submitted maintenance requests. And lastly, a page to display the received requests for the maintenance department to interact with.</p>

      <article id="breadboard">
        <h3>Breadboarding</h3>
        <p>
        Breadboarding is a concept that can help designers and developers structure the system being created. I learned this practice from "Shape Up" written by Ryan Singer and chose to do this because it helps me conceptualize the components of the interface and build a better flow of experience for the users. </p>
        <p>
        Breadboards are made of three basic things: places, affordances, and connection lines. The 'Place' is represented as an underlined label which stand for things that can be navigated toâ€”like pages or pop-ups. 'Affordances' are components that user can act on, such as buttons fields or copies of text. Lastly, 'Connection Lines' are exactly what they sound and this shows how affordances link to places with an arrow .</p>
