      <p>Your school wants to improve the upkeep of campus facilities by creating a new system for reporting any facilities that may need maintenance or repair. Design an experience that allows students to report building or equipment issues on campus. Consider the process of those filing the report and of those receiving and taking action on the issues.</p>

        <h2>My Process</h2>
        <p>
          For this problem, I've decided to look into the maintenance request system of Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT)â€”to evaluate it then build from it. The first step I took in approaching the design prompt was to identify the problem. "What did we have and what are the issues with it?" Answering these questions would help me build a better solution. To do this, I've evaluated the system in two ways: through contextual inquiry and heuristic evaluation. Ideally, the contextual inquiry would be conducted with more users and with input from those receiving the orders, however, I was unable to do this due to time constraint. After conducting one contextual inquiry and a heuristic evaluation of the system, I move on to step two. </p>
        <p>
          Step two is where I started to create the solution. I gradually built up my prototype by creating a breadboard, followed by a wireframe, then the high-fidelity prototype. I designed the interfaces as much as I was able to, however, I was unable to create the prototype with transitions and effects. </p>
        <p>
          Overall, I'm very proud of what I've accomplished and hope that it's sufficient as part of my application. I enjoyed the challenge and look forward to facing more of them soon. </p>

      <article id="contextual-inquiry">
        <h3>Contextual Inquiry</h3>
        <p>
        The users are given a task to complete using IIT's maintenance request system. The task for this contextual inquiry (CI) is to submit a request regarding cockroaches being found in the first floor restroom of Kaplan Institute. Users are requested to talk as they think and are encouraged to interact freely with the interface. For this CI we will not be officially submitting anything to the maintenance system, but will complete all steps before the submission.</p>
        <p>For brevity, I did not include the full transcript of the CI, instead I've included an outline of the steps they took with their observations. Each user will have a profile summary followed by their insights from their performance.</p>

          <h4>Wanmin (Mina) Zhang, 22</h4>

          <article class="ci-article">
            <h5>Profile</h5>
            <p>Mina is a student of IIT and is earning her degree in Information Technology and Management with a minor in Communications. She has experience in building interfaces and is knowledgable of user-centered design. She has never used this system before or anything similar to it.</p>

            <h5>Insights</h5>
            <figure><img src="assets/images/ss1.png" alt="Home page for system maintenance requests">
              <figcaption>This is the home page of the maintenance request system. Mina shares that the website is unappealing and underwhelming. She points out the wasted space on the right and the almost empty navigation bar on the left.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure><img src="assets/images/ss2.png" alt="Categories of maintenance issues">
              <figcaption>For the task at hand, Mina felt unsure whether to choose 'Restroom Issues' or 'Pest Control'. She chooses to go for 'Pest Control'.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure><img src="assets/images/ss3.png" alt="Pop-up form">
              <figcaption>Upon clicking 'Pest Control' the issue form is displayed as a pop-up box with four different fields. Mina remarks, "I don't like this pop-up box because I have an automatic reaction to immediately close them, but obviously I shouldn't if I want to submit this form."</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure><img src="assets/images/ss4.png" alt="Suggested result for building name">
              <figcaption>The system suggests a result as Mina types the building name of Kaplan Institute. She's quite impressed with this since Kaplan Institute is a new building and she wasn't sure if the school would have updated the building list.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure><img src="assets/images/ss5.png" alt="Error with abbreviated names">
              <figcaption>Mina tries to input other building names to see how the system would behave. At one point she enters "mtcc" which is the name that students use to refer to the McCormick Tribute Campus Center. She frustratingly comments, "It says that MTCC isn't a building, but if it's not then what is it?" She types in "McCormick" which gives the correct result. Out of curiosity, she clicks on the blue icon on the right of the 'Building' field to choose from the list of buildings and select MTCC.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure><img src="assets/images/ss6.png" alt="A new pop-up box for building selection">
              <figcaption>A new pop-up box containing the building list opens on top of the current one. Mina says, "I'm bothered because this feels like inception. It's like they're trying to see how gray they can make everything." She then exits the building list.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure><img src="assets/images/ss7.png" alt="A new pop-up box for room selection">
              <figcaption>Mina clicked on the blue icon of the "Room #" field which displayed another pop-up box. Mina comments, "I'm annoyed. They have a scrolling list that goes vertically but it also only shows 10 items, then you have to click on this left arrow." Mina was unable to find the first floor restroom on the room list and becomes even more frustrated. She says, "I guess I realized that I made a huge mistake because there's no room option for bathrooms so I guess I should have picked 'Restroom Issues' instead! How was I supposed to know that? Now I have to do it all over again."</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure><img src="assets/images/ss9.png" alt="Type in 'Other' as request">
              <figcaption>Mina exits the form she was filling and selects 'Restroom Issues' to start the whole process again. She fills the other fields and gets to the request specification. There was no option for 'Pest Control' in the list so she had to select 'Other' and type in her request. Needless to say, she didn't like it.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure><img src="assets/images/ss8.png" alt="Drag and drop file">
              <figcaption>Finally she reaches the 'Files' upload box. She remarks that she likes the ability to drag her items to the box to upload. She uploads an image and completes the form.</figcaption>
            </figure>
